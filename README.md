# Spring Boot Project - Backend Developer Internship

This repository contains the work I completed during my internship as a **Backend Developer Intern** at **Etiya** from July 2023 to August 2023. The primary focus was mastering the fundamentals of Java Spring Boot projects, database design, and REST API development.

## üìö Project Overview

### Key Features:
- **Spring Boot Application**: Developed a complete Spring Boot application with key layers such as Services, Controllers, Entities, Repositories, Mappers, and DTOs.
- **PostgreSQL Database Design**: Designed and implemented a relational database with proper One-to-One, One-to-Many, and Many-to-Many relationships.
- **JDBC and Hibernate**: Leveraged JDBC and Hibernate for seamless database operations and ORM capabilities.
- **REST APIs**: Created and tested RESTful APIs using **Postman** for CRUD operations.

## üöÄ Project Highlights

1. **Database Design**: 
   - Created a detailed relational diagram and implemented it in PostgreSQL.
   - Defined relationships like One-to-One, One-to-Many, and Many-to-Many.

2. **REST API Development**:
   - Built endpoints to handle CRUD operations.
   - Ensured API performance and reliability through testing with Postman.

3. **Modular Architecture**:
   - Adopted a clean architecture by dividing the project into Services, Controllers, and Repositories for better scalability and maintainability.

4. **Continuous Learning**:
   - Completed Udemy courses on JDBC and Hibernate.
   - Authored two blogs sharing insights and best practices in Spring Boot development.
